# AtariBreakoutAI
This program will play a custom made Atari Breakout

It is currently under development

Code refactoring is required

## Requirement
Packages and Python verion stated is for reference only

Those are the verions that we've used while developing

You can try other versions if you want, but it might not work

### Packages:
* TensorFlow r1.1<br>Reference: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/
* Scikit-Learn 0.18.1<br>Reference: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html
* PyGame 1.9.2<br>Reference: https://www.pygame.org/docs/genindex.html

### System:
* We recommend CPU with 4 or more cores and 8GB ram
* We highly recommend to use GPU with TensorFlow GPU version
* This program is developed with python 3.5.X to 3.6.X, other versions might not run.
